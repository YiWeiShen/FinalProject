## Application
- Database for a restaurant using MongoDB...
- Main python package: PyMongo for developing and interact with MongoDB database.

### Problem to Solve	
- To better run a restaurant, one thing we can do is to have a digitalized menu for the dishes and the customer information. So building a database can be a good solution for a restaurant owner to make sense of the customer information and better manage the menu dish information.
